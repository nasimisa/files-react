# Frontend Home Assignment

A React-based file and folder management application built with TypeScript, Mantine UI, and React Router. The application runs, but the code intentionally contains issues and suboptimal patterns. Your task is to analyze the codebase, improve it, and explain your decisions.

There is no single “correct” solution. We are interested in your decision-making, trade-offs, and reasoning.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: >= 18.18.0
- **pnpm**: >= 10.13.1

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd files-react-assessment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).

4. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   pnpm preview
   ```

## Expectations

We are interested in how you:

- Read unfamiliar code
- Identify problems worth solving
- Debug unexpected behavior
- Refactor incrementally
- Apply sound TypeScript and React practices
- Consider the product and user perspective
- Communicate technical decisions

---

## What to Do

- Improve the codebase in ways you consider meaningful
- Fix issues you identify
- Refactor where it adds clarity, safety, or composability
- Improve usability where you believe it provides value
- Leave areas untouched if you believe they don’t warrant change

Avoid full rewrites.

## Notes & Reasoning

Please include brief notes explaining:

- What you noticed
- What you changed and why
- Trade-offs or assumptions
- What you would improve next with more time

This can be a `NOTES.md` file.

---

## Constraints

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Mantine UI
- Minimal external dependencies

---

## Time

⏱️ Expected time: 4–6 hours

If you choose to spend more or less time, please mention it in your notes.

---

## Submission

- Share a Git repository
- Ensure the project runs locally
- Include your notes

---

## Final Note

This exercise reflects how we work day-to-day: improving existing code through small, thoughtful changes.

We value judgment and clarity over the amount of code changed.

Good luck with your assessment! 🚀
